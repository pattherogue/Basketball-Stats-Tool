#Proper use of Dunder Main
#Import player and team data
    #import from constants.py
    #should not be hard coded into script
    #changes should be reflected

#Create a clean_data function
    #read existing player data from PLAYERS im constants.py
#Create balance_teams function
#Console readability matters
#Displaying the statsd
